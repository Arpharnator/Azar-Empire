Introduces the Azaran Empire as a new faction.

The galaxy is being invaded by the Azaran Empire. They are a highly centralized empire bringing their own planet into the galaxy from which they will produce ships to take over planets and build structures to bolster their production.
Face off against them in order to gain rewards and hack their facilities to gain new ships to use either against them or the AI.
Or fail and watch them take over the galaxy.
Includes rewards for Necromancer, alongside some rewards for Humans to keep on fighting.
