    description="The galaxy is being invaded by the Azaran Empire. They are a highly centralized empire bringing their own planet into the galaxy from which they will produce ships to take over planets and build structures to bolster their production.

&lt;color=#f25e1c&gt;VARIABLE IMPACT:&lt;/color&gt; Depending on the intensity and invasion time the impact of the faction will be vary greatly. For example an immediate invasion, intensity 10 will be around the realms of High Impact to Extremely High impact, while a having the invasion later could turn it into a complete flop. Here's what you can expect overall :
They will be relativaly weak at the beginning, and struggle to expand but given enough time their facilities will provide ample production to take over the galaxy. Their homeworld will be a vast planet able to house countless facilities, even without much territory they could still be a menace!"
